Things that are not yet implemented:

* Cleanup: eliminate NB-specific code, updaters, etc.
* --sample
* --1.8 and --1.9
* --server and --client
* --debug and --jdb
* --ng and --ng-server
* Scanning for launcher args should be aborted by '--'
* support %JAVA_HOME%?
* Do we need separate x86 and x64 binaries?
* Better handling of bootclasspath vs classpath,
  currently they are identical, I was lazy.
