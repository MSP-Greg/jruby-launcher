Things that are not yet implemented:

* --jdb
* Do we need separate x86 and x64 binaries?
  (Without separate binaries, x64 java will always be launched out-of-process).
* Better handling of bootclasspath vs classpath,
  currently they are identical, I was lazy.
* Ability to detach the console, ability to launch with new console
  (these things are supported by Netbeans launchers, it seems)
* Make the launcher behavior depend on the executable name:
  jruby.exe - normal JRuby, jirb.exe - JRuby IRB, blah.exe --> jruby -S blah
